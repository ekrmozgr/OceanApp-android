# OceanApp


   This is an android app aiming to create an environment where people can gift courses to their friends
   
   The app doesn't stream any course videos. It just shows the courses of agreed providers and after you buy the course it sends course keys as a mail to the one who you choose. Later they can unlock the course that you gifted on the providers website and watch it
  
      The app works with OceanAPI(among the repositories) and MSSQL
   
      Volley library was used to manage API calls
      
      The app and OceanAPI works async all the way down
